        Soil Nutrient analysis for plant health-Actually is about predicting and soil to ensure
        what crops can be grown in certain region or a place.This project includes a predicting model
        in a web application where the predicting model takes inputs of all requirments and 
        predicts the crop accordingly.
        We have used HTML,CSS,PYTHON and many other required languages to build this predicting
        model and web application.
